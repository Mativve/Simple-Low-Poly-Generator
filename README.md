# Simple Low Poly Generator

## Demo


## Idea and creation process
This year I decided to start my adventure with Vue ðŸ˜Ž That's why the idea for this generator came up.
The generator uses a special library that generates a low poly texture. In addition, I created a list of ready-made colors based on webgradients.com which can be freely modified after selecting.
I am aware that the current code may be tragic - but you have to start somewhere ðŸ˜Š In the future (I hope) it will change ðŸ’ª

## Functionality
* Dimensions of canvas
* Cell size of the mesh [less but more or more but less]
* Variance of the mesh [more or less triangle]
* Seed to hold current pattern
* List of ready colors palette
* Customable palette [possibility to add more colors, mirror and shuffle function of colors]
* Reset current configuration
* Export to PNG file
* Show/Hide additional information
* Light/Dark theme

## Technologies & libraries
To create the project, I used:
* Spectre.css
* Pickr
* Feather icons
